# daybuildr
A small android project developed over 6 weeks for a Software Project Management paper.

It takes some user preferences for activities they would like to complete around their schedule,
and generates events based off those preferences. The general idea was to eventually integrate some
smart maching learning in order to identify which activities users prefer, and when they like to take 
part in them, to help busy people structure their day more effectively. 

The application makes use of Firebase for Authentication and the Backend.

A few screenshots of the application:
